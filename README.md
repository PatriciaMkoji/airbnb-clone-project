🚀 Technology Stack
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This project utilizes a modern and scalable technology stack to ensure efficient development, smooth performance, and maintainability.

🔧 Backend & API
Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building robust, scalable, and secure backend applications.
Django REST Framework (DRF): An extension of Django that simplifies the creation and management of RESTful APIs, enabling seamless communication between frontend and backend.

🗄️ Database & Query Language
PostgreSQL: A powerful, open-source relational database system used for secure and structured data storage.
GraphQL: A flexible query language that allows clients to request only the data they need, improving efficiency over traditional REST calls.

⚙️ Task Management & Caching
Celery: A distributed task queue for handling asynchronous operations such as sending emails, background data processing, or task scheduling.
Redis: An in-memory key-value store used for caching, session storage, and as a message broker for Celery tasks.

📦 Containerization & Deployment
Docker: A containerization tool that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated environments, ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production.

CI/CD Pipelines: Automated processes that streamline the testing, integration, and deployment of code changes, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery.

🛠️ Feature Breakdown
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This section outlines the core features of the Airbnb Clone project and how each contributes to delivering a seamless booking experience for users.

1. API Documentation
The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard, making integration with frontend and third-party systems straightforward and well-structured. Django REST Framework supports full CRUD operations, while GraphQL allows for flexible and precise data queries, enhancing developer experience and performance.

2. User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
This feature enables secure user registration, login, and profile management. It ensures that only authenticated users can access certain actions such as bookings, property management, and reviews.

3. Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Users (especially hosts) can list, edit, view, and delete rental properties. This feature serves as the foundation of the platform, allowing accommodations to be made visible to potential guests.

4. Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Facilitates the reservation process, allowing users to book available properties, check availability, and manage their stay details. It is tightly integrated with both the property listings and user accounts.

5. Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Handles financial transactions related to bookings. Users can make secure payments, while the system ensures transaction status tracking and linkage to relevant bookings.

6. Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Allows guests to leave feedback on their stay, which helps maintain quality and trust on the platform. Hosts and future guests benefit from honest reviews and ratings.

7. Database Optimizations
To ensure high performance at scale, the project includes indexing of commonly queried fields and caching strategies. These improvements reduce response time and minimize database load, particularly in data-heavy operations like searching and filtering properties.
